This is the "In Your Own Words Exercise"
1. What is scope? 
  -Global is when the entire file has access to a variable. This could mean other files as well could see it. The local scope is only within that block or function. 
2. Why are global variables avoided?
  -Side effects and hard to debug
3. Explain JS's strict mode.
  -Requires all variables to be declared. 

'use strict';

function () {
  variable = 2; //error

}

4. What are side effects, and what is a pure function?
  -When a variable is reassigned to a value that you don't expect or want. 
  -A pure function doesn't create side effects.
